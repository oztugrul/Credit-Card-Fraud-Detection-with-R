Use the data from Kaggle creditcard.csv, predict imbalanced fraud and non_fraud transactions.

Test the performance of the machine learning model with **ROC Curve (AUC:0.967)** and **PR (Precision Recall) Curve (AUC:0.846)**.


You can try other versions of up sampling and down sampling trainin data given in codes. We use **SMOTE** strategy for training data.

Exteme Gradient Boosting with L1 and L2 regularization machine learning model is used for training.
